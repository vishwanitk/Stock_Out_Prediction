Stock_Out_Prediction

A stockout happens when inventory runs out before the next replenishment cycle. This means the planned stock doesn't last as long as expected, sometimes causing major disruptions.
For inventory managers handling 3,000 to 5,000 SKUs daily, it's practically impossible to manually monitor each item for unusual consumption trends - whether a sudden spike in demand or a steep drop in consumption.
To address this, I built a simple decision support system using Python and basic statistical principles. The goal: to help inventory teams identify unusual consumption patterns early, so they can take action before a stockout occurs, ultimately improving inventory service levels.
